# Obsidian x Google Calendar Plugin

An [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) plugin that synchronizes [google events](https://calendar.google.com/) from the calendar and manages them like tasks.

**Note**:

1. Please be aware that **this plugin relies on the [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) plugin** to list tasks within a specific date range. **Please make sure you have the Dataview plugin installed before using this plugin**.
2. Our task format is borrowed from tasks, but we **do not support recurring tasks** at the moment.
3. To sync tasks from Obsidian to the calendar, you need to attach a start time element to the task (i.e. ðŸ›« YYYY-MM-DD), then click the sync icon or call the `Sync with Calendar` command.
4. Our task synchronization is **centered around calendar events**, which means that after syncing tasks from Obsidian to the calendar, modifications to tasks in Obsidian will not be synced to the calendar. To further modify the schedule, you need to modify it directly in the calendar. The changes made in the calendar will be automatically synced back to Obsidian later.
5. This plugin is still in early alpha and is subject to change at any time!

## Installation & Usage

### First of All

- You need a Google Calendar credentials file. You can apply for it yourself:
    - Refer [create project guide](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-project) to create a Google Cloud Project
    - Refer [enable apis guide](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/enable-apis) to enable your Google Calendar's API.
    - [Configure OA Screen](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent?)
    - [Prepare to get your OA credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/oauthclient)
        - Select "Desktop Application"
        - Input a name for this OA Application.
        - Download the OAClient credentials file.
- Place the credentials file in `VaultFolder/.obsidian/calendar.sync.credentials.json`

### Manually installing the plugin

- Download `main.js`, `styles.css`, `manifest.json` from the [release page](https://github.com/dustinksi/obsidian-sync-calendar/releases).
- Copy the downloaded files to `VaultFolder/.obsidian/plugins/your-plugin-id/`.

**Note**: You can also compile this plugin yourself:

- Clone this repo.
- Run `npm i` or `yarn` to install dependencies.
- Run `npm run dev` to start compilation in watch mode.

### Use this Plugin

- Place a code block like the following in any note:
    ````markdown
    ```sync-calendar
    name: "{numberTodos} todos @ Apr. 21"
    timeMin: "2023-04-21"
    timeMax: "2023-04-22"
    ```
    ````
- Swap to preview mode and the plugin should replace this code block with the materialized result.

> If you are synchronizing your vault, I recommend explicitly ignoring the `VaultFolder/.obsidian/calendar.sync.token.json` file for security reasons, if possible.

## Inputs

| Name              | Type   | Description                                                                                                                            | Default                          |
| ----------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `name`            | string | The title for the query. You can use the `{numberTodos}` template which will be replaced by the number of todos returned by the query. | {numberTodos} todos in calendar  |
| `timeMin`         | string | A string that conforms to moment.js, the minimum time (including `timeMin`) for events.                                                | One week before the current time |
| `timeMax`         | string | A string that conforms to moment.js, the maximum time (excluding `timeMax`) for events.                                                | null                             |
| `refreshInterval` | number | The auto-refresh interval in seconds. Set to `-1` to disable auto-refresh.                                                             | 10                               |

**Note**: `timeMin` and `timeMax` will be parsed by [moment.js](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/parsing/). Ideally, Any string that satisfies moment.js can be parsed, for example:

- "2023-04-21"
- "2023-04-21 16:00"
- "2023-04-21T08:00:00.000Z"

**Note**: About fetching interval: For example, if there is an event whose time span is "2023-04-21 14:00" - "2023-04-21 16:00", if you do not want this event to be displayed during crawling, you should specify `timeMin: "2023-04-21 16:00"`.

**Note**: `sort`, `filter`ï¼Œ`group` are features which will be released in next version. Welcome to contribute!

## Command

Currently, only one command is supported, which is used to manually trigger the synchronization of tasks from Obsidian to Calendar.

`Sync with Calendar`:

This command will fetch tasks with a startDate (i.e. ðŸ›« YYYY-MM-DD) in Obsidian.
